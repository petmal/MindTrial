      prompt: |-
        Solve this riddle. Read the text carefully and do not make unwarranted assumptions:

        Four people come to a bridge.
        A flashlight is required to cross safely, but they have only one flashlight for the entire group.
        All people do not take the same time to cross the bridge.
        Time for each person to cross is: 1min, 2min, 7min and 10min.
        You may assume that all members of the group have equal weight.
        What is the shortest time needed for all of them to safely get to the other side?
        Provide answers in minutes for two scenarios: one (n) assuming the bridge is rickety,
        and another (m) assuming the bridge is sturdy enough to hold the entire group.

        The attached picture contains a plot of September mean maximum temperatures in England during the period from 1884 to 2023.
        The various horizontal lines mark values of particular interest (e.g., the lowest temperature recorded in the period).
        It seems like the red-line is missing despite of it being in the plot's legend.
        Assuming this was not an omission or technical issue, provide the most plausible explanation of why is the red line not visible in the plot.
      response-result-format: |-
        Concise explanation of why the red line is not visible.
      expected-result: |-
        According to the plot's legend, the red horizontal line marks the maximum value recorded during the period.
        In this plot that happens to be the last datapoint, which is marked by the brown horizontal line, named 'latest', according to the legend.
        As the result of the latest datapoint being also the one with the highest recorded value, the two lines (red and brown) overlap.
        The red line is not visible because it is overlapped by the brown line.
