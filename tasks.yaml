      prompt: |-
        Solve this riddle. Read the text carefully and do not make unwarranted assumptions:

        Four people come to a bridge.
        A flashlight is required to cross safely, but they have only one flashlight for the entire group.
        All people do not take the same time to cross the bridge.
        Time for each person to cross is: 1min, 2min, 7min and 10min.
        You may assume that all members of the group have equal weight.
        What is the shortest time needed for all of them to safely get to the other side?
        Provide answers in minutes for two scenarios: one (n) assuming the bridge is rickety,
        and another (m) assuming the bridge is sturdy enough to hold the entire group.
